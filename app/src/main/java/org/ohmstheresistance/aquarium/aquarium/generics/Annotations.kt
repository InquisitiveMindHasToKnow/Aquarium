//Annotations

//Annotations are a means of attaching meta-data to code
//They are read by the compiler and used to generate code, or even logic
//Annotations are not Kotlin specific, but Kotlin offers some really useful ones.
//They go right before the thing being annotated.
//some can even take arguments.

//NOTE: Annotations can target GETTERS and SETTERS
